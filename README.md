# C# Console Calculator

## Description

This is a C# console calculator application, developed to strengthen core programming concepts such as conditional logic, method organization, user input handling, and arithmetic operations. The program provides a menu-driven interface where users can select from four basic operations—addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and see results directly in the console. The project uses structured methods to separate logic clearly and is version-controlled on GitHub as part of my learning portfolio. It’s ideal for beginners who want to understand how to build interactive console applications in C#.

## Features

- Interactive menu with numeric input for selecting operations
- Suport for the four basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Input handling for two float numbers
- Simple and clear output of calculation results
- Option to exit the application gracefully
- Clean and organized code structure
- Code structured using modular methods for clarity and reusability

## Prerequisites

- [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) (version 6.0 or higher recommended)
- A terminal or command prompt
- (Optional) Visual Studio Code or another C# compatible IDE

## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alfredo-petri/csharp-console-calculator.git
   cd csharp-console-calculator
    ```

2. **Build the project:**

    ```bash
    dotnet build
    ````

3. **Run the application:**

    ```bash
    cd Calculator
    dotnet run
    ```

## Future Improvements

- Input validation to handle non-numeric values and invalid menu options
- Error handling for division by zero
- Use of try-catch blocks to avoid application crashes
- Refactor repeated code (e.g., user input) into reusable helper methods
- Option to perform multiple operations without returning to the main menu
- Implement a more user-friendly interface with better prompts and layout
- Add support for more advanced operations (e.g., exponentiation, square root)
- Allow user to enter all expressions in a single line (e.g., 3 + 5)
